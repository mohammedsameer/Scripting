Currently, when zuora license expires on 05/31, certain functionality in CS app concerning pro-customers will cease to work due to baked in zuora dependency. The specific functionality includes:
a) Cancel Account - user-requested b) Cancel Account - Non-payment c) Change Trial Expiration Date  d) Activate Suspended/Cancelled Account
These admin features can be accessed via "Pro->Manage Customers->Edit Billing" option within CS app.

This fix removes the zuora dependency to enable successful working of above mentioned functionality.
Files changed:
1. editBilling.gsp: Removed the "Start New Paid Subscription" option from drop down as its no longer applicable
2. ProCustomerManager.java: Removed the salesforce email trigger(will be covered in BILL-833) & zuora reference
3. ProController.groovy: Remove unused input parameters
4. ZuoraBilling.java: Removed the zuora reference while canceling, activating , updating expiration date & unused method
5. ZuoraBillingTest.java: Updated to support validation of a cancelled credit card customer with no payment/credit card setup

Successfully ran ZuoraBillingTest. Additionally the following acceptance tests were successfully run from local CS app:

a) Cancel Account - user-requested:
  i) Past/Current Date: When applied on an active customer with active/new billing state, successfully updates billing state as cancelled & updates client status as inactive
